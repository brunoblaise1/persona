  Umm, In all honesty I donot know how to start this I know there are things I wish i had done different last year but overall last year was the best year of my life I learnt so many things, It was my first year that I had done things that were succesfull.

  I had some taste of success, if you are reading this i know you will find so many grammar errors but that's me and i like to do things fast and break them and revise them again for some other time(pratically never).



I have always in my life been an outsider everywhere I go I feel like I don't belong there, it has caused me so many suffering most of time I feel alone and emptiness.

I always ask myself a question: why me?, most of the time I think about creating something that can change people lives for better and make the world a better place.

I guess I have the answer to my question, I think and act different from most of my peers I am always learning something new and trying to find solutions for problems outside class.


### 2024

  2024 started as other years I had nothing in my mind, I mean it literally nothing; things changes slowly as the days passed by.

  Let me explain...

#### Jan

If you remember I told I had a club called Morncast but 2023 I had done less to what i wished to do and this was a perfect time as **Hack Club** introduced pizza grant, you would draw a pizza and then you would get $100 for your next club meeting and buy some pizza so that's the first thing I did.

This was my first time gathering people outside school in one place, I had to search for a venue I think we were about 30 people and luckily i convince someone to get us a place for free, it was super awesome, all this was my first time and things I wish i knew that

- Perfect means nothing 
- If you ask you will be given(never be afraid)

and here are some pictures
