Umm, In all honesty I donot know how to start this I know there are things I wish i had done different last year but overall last year was the best year of my life I learnt so many things, It was my first year that I had done things that were succesfull.

I had some taste of success, if you are reading this i know you will find so many grammar errors but that's me and i like to do things fast and break them and revise them again for some other time(pratically never).

I have always in my life been an outsider everywhere I go I feel like I don't belong there, it has caused me so many suffering most of time I feel alone and emptiness.

I always ask myself a question: why me?, most of the time I think about creating something that can change people lives for better and make the world a better place.

I guess I have the answer to my question, I think and act different from most of my peers I am always learning something new and trying to find solutions for problems outside class.

### 2024

2024 started as other years I had nothing in my mind, I mean it literally nothing but gradually things changed slowly as the days passed by.

Let me explain...

#### Jan

If you remember I told I had a club called Morncast but 2023 I had done less to what i wished to do and this was a perfect time as **Hack Club** introduced pizza grant, you would draw a pizza and then you would get $100 for your next club meeting and buy some pizza so that's the first thing I did.

This was my first time gathering people outside school in one place, I had to search for a venue I think we were about 30 people and luckily i convince someone to get us a place for free, it was super awesome, all this was my first time and things I wish i knew that

- Perfect means nothing
- If you ask you will be given(never be afraid)

and here are some pictures

## Mar

Umm, now my mind is playing trickes on me. I believe I had done nothing this month, I might have to rethink about this.

## Apr

This is was the month that would lead to a snowball effect, ok what did i do this month and why am i saying this?

Did you know the word that "hackathon" if not you in luck, so basically it is an event that programmer work together to build something in a very short amount of time like a marathon but a hackathon is not associated with hacking even if somemay I guess that would be a CTF(capture the flag).

Things I did in this month:

- Bought a domain name for the hackathon website
- My first meeting with Irembo, shout out to Jessica for helping out [irembo.com].
- Met with I would say my mentor in HR things, shout out to Nina for all great advice and being a very integral part of planning and making this a reality [bktechouse.rw]

## May, June and July

Continued planning the events and boarded some people to help to be co-organizers, worked every hard no my exams, Yoo! I closed the year in 10 top I would tell this in March I would have laughed at you.

## Aug

The best month of my life at a till now, things I did this month were beyond me I swear, I read 5 books from back to back and organized the first high school hackathon in Rwanda and the largest a till now, it was insane the thing I am proud of is that I managed to moviated other people to do so now many high
school students are doing that.

One last important thing here we being a journey to organize [HackEA](https://hackeastafrica.org/)

Enough of words I need to see pictures wait let me tell you things we learnt.

- A good team will help you do great stuff, a bad one opposite and I don't want to point figures but I had a bad one very bad, I did everything myself so, choose wisely.
- Read books you have time, please this will change you for better. ooh this is the list of those i read in this year (48 Laws of power, Richest man in babylon, Atomic Habits, 5 AM club and the last one Outliers)
- Ask for help especialy when you think you know something and when you don't.
- Go a head do the thing you are most afraid of I did, you must ask what legacy do you need to leave behind you.

Also during this time I become a SAD(Special Agent Division) which is responsible to make Hack Club more welcoming and also to connect people in general through organizing events, I enjoyed every event.

This month was filled with many stuff I participated in High Seas one of Hack Club events and oh boy did I do so many things and learnt a lot after every long time not programming, shout to to Bartsar for helping out and understanding me when I did stupid stuff.
