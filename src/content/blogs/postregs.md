Have you ever wanted to add array data types in your application for example when trying to make a quiz app and you had been confused? How to do it in PostgreSQL and as a bonus I will show you how to add it using Nodejs and test it in postman In addition I assume you have basic knowledge of both technologies. In the leading paragraphs will see how to implement it.

**Requirements**

- Nodejs installed

- Postgresql installed

- Postman installed

**What will cover**

1. Array Data type in Postgres

2. Post data in the table using nodejs

3. Test it using Postman

**Steps to follow**

**NPM installs **

```
npm i express pg cors
```

**files**

**database.sql file**

```
CREATE TABLE test(
  test_id uuid DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  test_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  test_question VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  test_choice varchar[4] NOT NULL,  --this is important you can choose  it to be text number any thing you want but always specify the limit of your array
  test_answer  VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  teacher_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  class_year_content VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  timestamp timestamp default current_timestamp,
  PRIMARY KEY(test_id)
);
```

**data type in PostgreSQL how to declare arrays in Postgres**

```
CREATE TABLE sal_emp (
    name            text,
    pay_by_quarter  integer[],
    schedule        text[][],
   summary        varchar[]
);

```

**Nodejs part**

```
npm init -y
```

**db.js file in the parent folder and it should include this**

```
const Pool = require("pg").Pool;

const pool = new Pool({
  user: "postgres",
  password: "your password",
  host: "localhost",
  port: 5432,
  database: "your database"
});

module.exports = pool;
```

**index.js file in the parent folder and it should include this**

```
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const cors = require("cors");
const pool = require("./db");
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
//middleware
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json()); //req.body

//ROUTES//

app.post('/test', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const {name, question, answers, email, classe} = req.body;
    const newTodo = await pool.query(
      'INSERT INTO test (test_name, test_question, test_choice, test_answer, teacher_email, class_year_content) VALUES ($1, $2, $3,$4,$5, $6) RETURNING *',
      [name, certificate, question, req.body.choices, answers, email, classe],
    );

    res.json(newTodo.rows[0]);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err.message);
  }
});


app.get('/test', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = await pool.query('SELECT * from test');

    res.json(user.rows);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err.message);
    res.status(500).send('Server error');
  }
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`server started ${PORT}`);
});
```

make sure to run

```
 npm start
```

**postman**
